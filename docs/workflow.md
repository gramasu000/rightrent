# Planning Workflow

* Overall Task of App
* Technologies going to be used
(The following will change based on the technologies I use.)
* List of endpoints
* Links between endpoints
* Wireframes
* Write Comments (Plan for ~100 unit tests)
* Function declarations, test declarations, and comments of html tags only
* Fill everything in
* Run Tests
* Make as executable (No planning needed - just code it)
* Deploy to server (No planning needed - just deploy it)
