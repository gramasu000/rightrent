# Suggestions

    - We want to make it easy to change stuff, but secure. So we give Are-You-Sure alerts in case the user wants to change stuff.
    - Allow the document generation to be created in batches
    - Have an authentication system
    - Model it after google sheets visually?
    - Allow it to enter in "historical" stuff
