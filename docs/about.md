# Overall Task of App

To be used by people managing buildings or apartments that are rented to people.
This web app keep track of 
* lease term
* rent information (monthly payment, extra payments, balance due)
* renter information, building information, etc.  
A secondary feature of this web app is to generate letters (for word document) for renters if their rent is due, or if their lease expires, etc.
  
# Suggestions

* We want to make it easy to change stuff, but secure. So we give Are-You-Sure alerts in case the user wants to change stuff.
* Allow the document generation to be created in batches
* Have an authentication system
* Model it after google sheets visually?
* Allow it to enter in "historical" stuff
