"""
    In this file, I will define several utility functions to 
        handle database connections, requests and responses
"""

"""
    get_db() - Creates a connection to database instance in instance folder,
            sets it up so that table rows will be dictionaries,
                and attaches it to g object.

            and print out a message
     
    init_app(app) - We attach the close_db function as a callback whenever the
